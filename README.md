# Speech-recognition-and-TTS-program

# This program is designed to allow users to interact with a computer through speech recognition and text-to-speech technology. 
<br>The program listens for user input and processes it using two functions: "zeus()" and "chatgpt()". 
The "zeus()" function is called when the user says "help", and it provides access to various APIs, such as Wikipedia, Google, and YouTube, 
allowing users to search for information or perform tasks like playing music or checking the time. 
<br>
The "chatgpt()" function is called when the user says "chat", and it uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate a response to the user's input,
enabling the computer to carry out conversations with the user. 
<br>
The program runs in a loop, continually listening for user input, and handles any errors that may occur during speech recognition.
<br>
This program is an example of how cutting-edge technologies like speech recognition and natural language processing can be combined to create powerful and useful tools for interacting with computers.
